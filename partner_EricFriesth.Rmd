Eric Friesth, ericf8 on github

Aashwin and I switched roles for this lab, so the most recent commit is him deleting old files from the repo. ID: 5ff0d71655a3ff461847613bc25fe55d685022b7

I was able to knit Aashwin's Rmd file.

Something that Aashwin and I found to make git and github easier was look up cheat sheets and free online learning tools to help us out.
